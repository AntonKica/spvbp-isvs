Cybersecurity_Definition_Gaps_v1_0

### cybersecurity and cyberspace

- Cybersecurity shall refer to security of cyberspace
- cyberspace refers to the set of links and relationships between objects that are accessible through a generalised telecommunications network, and
to the set of objects themselves where they present interfaces allowing their remote control, remote
access to data, or their participation in control actions within that Cyberspace,
- cybersecurity shall encompass the CIA paradigm for relationships and objects within cyberspace
- extend CIA paradigm to address protection of privacy for legal entities (people and corporations), and to
address resilience (recovery from attack)

### information security (IS)

- Preservation of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information
- Confidentiality:  Property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes
- Integrity:        Property of accuracy and completeness
- Availability:     Property of being accessible and usable upon demand by an authorized entity

## 27000
- IS ensures CIA
- minimizing IS incidents

- is is achieved by:
    - implementation of aplecable set of controls, which are specified, implemented, monitored, reviewed and improved

### why is ISMS important

- risks associated with information assets need to be addressed
- managment of risks: physical, human, technological threats

### ISMS
- should be a strategic decision to implement
- should be seamesly integrated, scaled and updated according to organization's needs
- design & implementation should be influenced by organization's needs, size and structure
- should see to needs of stakeholders
- security threats come from wide range of sources

## 27001

4 Context of organization
    4.1 understanding organization and it's context
    4.2 understanding needs of interested parties
    4.3 determining scope of ISMS
    4.4 implementing ISMS

5 Leadership commitment
    5.1 commitment shall be demonstrated
    5.2 commitment shall be established: it's purposes, objectives, freamework, commitment
    5.3 roles, responsibilities and authorities shall be designated

6 Planning
- plan action to integrate, implement and evaluate effectivness of ISMS
- risk assessment:
    - set criteria of acceptance
    - repeatedly applied risk assessment of IS should be consistent
    - identify risks, analyze and evaluate (possible solutions?)
- formulate IS objectives, that you plan to achieve
- plan to change

7 Support
- resources, competence, awareness, communication, documented information

## 27014
- ISMS focuses on managment of risks of information
- information security forum (?)
